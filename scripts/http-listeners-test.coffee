#   test http listener script to test payloads from services.

#
# Notes:
#   Hubot includes support for the express web framework to serve up HTTP requests.
#   It listens on the port specified by the EXPRESS_PORT or PORT environment variables (preferred in that order)
#   and defaults to 8080. An instance of an express application is available at robot.router.
#   It can be protected with username and password by specifying EXPRESS_USER and EXPRESS_PASSWORD.
#   It can automatically serve static files by setting EXPRESS_STATIC.

# get mattermost channel from env var passed to container on deployment

  # example call: http://127.0.0.1:8080/hubot/test/channeName
  # examble to retrive in function: channeName  = req.params.channeName
